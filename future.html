		<h2>Goals</h2>
			<p> I want to have a well paying job, and have my own house by 25 years old. Even though I want a job that will be able to support me, I also want to have a job that I love. Although it will be tough, I’m planning to work hard. In addition, to live somewhere with a lot of greenery, such as Oregon.</p>
