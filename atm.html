		<h1>My Education</h1>
			<p> Right now, I am going to Bancroft Middle School as an 8th grader and I'm in the ATM program. ATM stands for Applied Technology Magnet, and is a 3 year elective. So, I've been in this program since 6th grade. I've learned many things from being in ATM.</p>

		<h2>6th Grade</h2>
			<p>In sixth grade I learned the basic tools on computers. I learned how to use Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, and other programs. I also learned how to correctly type. Towards the end of the year, I got to make very basic code.</p>

		<h2>7th Grade</h2>
			<p>In seventh grade I got to do more coding. I also got to learn how to use Photoshop and SketchUp. This was probably my favorite year, because I really enjoyed the Photoshop unit. Since I love photography, being able to take and edit photos was really fun. Although SketchUp was difficult, it was interesting to learn how to use it.</p>

		<h2>8th Grade</h2>
			<p>In 8th grade I got to learn how to code without any guidance. I memorized the formulas for code, and how to make it “come to life” with HTML. I also got to learn how to use IMovie and Garageband. One of the units we had was based on filming, and I loved it. We were on a short time schedule so it was stressful, but I enjoyed it.</p>

		<h2>How will ATM help me down the line?</h2>
			<p>ATM has set me up for my future. I’m focusing my high school on their computer program, so having experience in ATM will definitely help me. It has been extremely fun, and I have noticed the impact on my knowledge. I’m now able to help my friends and family with anything technical. In addition, I can do projects in other classes with ease due to my typing skills and basic knowledge in Microsoft programs.</p>
