		<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
			<p>In my free time I eat, take pictures, listen to all kinds of music, and go out with friends. I'm interested in travelling and photography. It would be a dream of mine to be able to travel the world and capture every famous landmark in a photo.</p>

		<h2>My Family</h2>
			<p>My family is my rock. They are extremely important to me, despite how chaotic we may be. I live with my mom, dad, and my “adopted” best friend Davyn. I also have an older brother Ricky, who passed away last April. My family and I have been blessed with three beautiful grandbabies. Although my family and I have been through a lot, we always have eachothers’ backs. </p>
